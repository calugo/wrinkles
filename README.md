## Support repository for several works investigating wrinkled surfaces in soft-matter surfaces.

A detailed document describing details about the geometry domain, mesh preparation and solution methods, for the scripts available here
can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/).

The scripts are witten in python 3x and require a working working version of [FEniCs](https://fenicsproject.org/). The script for the elastomer wrinkling dut to stretching also requires [FEniCs mechanics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018300979).

There are three main scripts in the SCRIPTS folder.

* MONOSTRETCH- Stretching of a slender monolayer volume.
* BISTRETCH - Compression of a bilayer composite.
* GROWTH3D - Morphoelastic growth of a bilayer composite.
